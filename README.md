# JavaScript Weather App

## Description
The is a fully responsive weather site that will allow users to input a city name and get real time weather information for that city along with a 5 day forcast.

## Goal
I have been learning a lot on Asynchronous JavaScript, APIs, and call back functions so I wanted to practice by building this weather website. Within the confines of this site, it should:

* Take the value of user's input and make a request to Accuweather API
* Return information from API in the form of JSON
* Update the UI with information including city name, daily weather temperature, highs and lows, current weather condition, date, and weather icon
* Throw an error if the data could not be returned and props an error message if user mispells city or inputs a non-existent city
