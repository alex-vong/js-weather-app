# JavaScript Weather App

## Description
To enhance my knowledge on Asynchronous JS and APIs, I wanted to create a weather site that will allow a user to look up weather conditions and temperatures by city. The site will also be fully responsive across all devices with a simple UI that is straightforward and easily understandable to the user.

## Goal

* Take the value of user's input and make a request to Accuweather API
* Return information from API in the form of JSON
* Update the UI with information including city name, daily weather temperature, highs and lows, current weather condition, date, and weather icon
* If user mispells or enters an unknown city, an error message will be thrown



# This is a Heading h1
## This is a Heading h2 
###### This is a Heading h6

## Emphasis

*This text will be italic*  
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**  
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

## Lists

### Unordered

### Ordered
